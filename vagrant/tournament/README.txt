There is a Swiss-style tornament Database design in this folder 

This is for project2 on Udacity's fullstack nano-dxcxcxegree

Please make sure that the Database is up by running 

"\i tournament.sql"  

in postgradsql or psql 

This file is in the tournament file where all the other related files are; it 
will create all the nescessary tables and views.
